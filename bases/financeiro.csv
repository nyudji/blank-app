Hence, appreciate it.Packaging: Not Good. The box was tempered, torn and damaged.Product: Ordered Black, received brown. Didn’t replace as the Color didn’t much mattered. Issue is with the seller though.Performance: The pen of good. Robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. Writes smooth.For anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.Edited: Have been using this pen for over 3 days now, I am facing issue of nib dryness. If I don’t use the pen for sometime. The pen doesn’t write at all. I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. It writes great when it starts writing. But the initial pick up is really bad. I have a platinum preppy too. It’s a better option to go with if the budget is tight. However, there we have good writing but bad looks.,Few points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer. (Compared with two other pens- Parker Vector and Luxor V5)1. Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the ""curve"" at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. Honestly, have not felt so at all. The grip is pretty medium, larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5. It wont create any problems holding it. I am an average 5'10 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance :) .2. Nib and feeder:  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 0.5 and Parker Fine nib. Few claim it is 0.7 / medium kinds. Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is Fine. It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough. Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  Plastic construction and feel in hand:  The cap is made of brass(as they say). The cap has a ""matte"" finish, not a glossy one. The clip and top is glossy. Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some ""looks"" to it when taking it out of the pocket :D . The pen itself- very much plastic. If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight ( just a feel factor how I felt). However this does not mean it is a cheap construction. It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. It makes one feel pretty solid holding it. The size if compared to other two is larger. It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger(which parker does not, Luxor does) , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. Without the clip it is very much balanced (Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top) , with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. Ink filling:  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppers(good old school days) , however this comes with the standard piston filling( as seen in the photo by Hari). When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! Few said it worked , few said it leaked. Need to substantiate it. Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. Writing after 3 weeks:  For Luxor, it works immediately! Even after 6 months it worked like magic. For Parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. For Elegante it did not start immediately. From school days used to have an Airmail (unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted) it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. However, how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down :) . It worked fairly after a break of one week.6. Colour:  Personally the ""looks"" of a pen hardly matter to me. Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. For few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it.  Parker gives a good classy look, Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. Neither a college going look nor an Executive look. On looks it does fair enough justice- The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon, Black and Blue. Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. This does enough for me.7. Spare Nibs and feeder:  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online. I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online (thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers :lticaptd: ) . After using this nib, I would personally not place any other nib. I am pretty happy about it. (always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change).8. Recommended for:  Its a must for student. At this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM. Parker, would never recommend it for students. If someone wants to carry it for exams- carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. Luxor- would be best. If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing :)  :)  :) .9. Value for Money:  For a standard person like me or a student, Luxor beats Elegante and Parker. However for a fountain pen- This is an excellent VFM :)Well, this sums up my experience after using it. Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it,★ First of all, it came in a really bad condition. The package was almost flattened. All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. Thank God it doesn't have any dent.★ Secondly, it is probably a used product. Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box.★ Thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the European standards. I am a Pilot lover, so I know what fine nib is. This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot. Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. You remember the experience for a long time. The handwriting also becomes better. That's lacking in this pen.* Thankfully it doesn't squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. I had two Wingsungs. Those were unbearably squirty.★ Fourthly, the grip is average.★ Fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. You may use it as a day to day pen.BUT DON'T STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY. EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET. TRUST ME, YOU WON'T LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS. I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM. I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE. SO I DON'T USUALLY USE THAT. THAT'S WHY I'VE BOUGHT THIS ONE.★ Lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please don't put the cap on the backside. Open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., it's really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller & amazon.,Its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., Some time spread over ink. And some time character cutting.... Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,I've been using this pen for about 3monthspros:Build quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingcons:Nib comes out easily,Just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back. I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers, Camlin, Parker (made in USA), Hero (China made). Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made. This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen. It makes us proud. Just superb pen. Very smooth. It is actually a no nonsense pen. Only thing...since I had read a few negative reviews about this...I am using it with PILOT BLUE ink. I don't know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what? Whatever it may be.....This pen with Pilot ink combination rocks...just superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN. Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/21C8ziy-IJL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Camlin-Elegante-Fountain-Pen-Black/dp/B00LY17RHI/ref=sr_1_476?qid=1672903018&s=computers&sr=1-476

At this price point, I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall, I'd say, for a small room, it's a 7/10.,Value for money, Satisfied with the product till now,This Led tv low budget Good 👍 Performance but picture & audio not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QvXYP2McL._SY88.jpg,Good,Tv is great but the installation guy asked me for 400₹ paid installation... Misleading information but again for this price it's good tv. Don't pay installation guy you can do it yourself,,I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I bought this 32 inch VW at 6150 after discounts. Picture quality and sound quality is good.I added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv. The connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs.So far, working as it should.Revising this after 9 days, the tv is not responding to switch off button. This is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote, the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red, instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv's screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick.

Since it was white, and therefore a very unappetising sight now, I needed a new one.Packaging: The design of packaging was perfect - stiff corrugated sandwich board box, foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top, board wrapping around the glass kettle, the whole unit inside a thick ply cover. Frankly, this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment. 5 * plus for the packaging design.Size: This is a small machine - and will make about 600 ml of coffee - sufficient for 2 mugs in one go. If you need a larger volume - look elsewhere.Body and finish: The plastic body is well made - the matte finish looks good. The bottom metal plate is seamless and black - will have to wait and see when spots appear. The kettle is good quality glass, and though no branding is present, feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps. The filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is OK - hopefully the spring and washer - which are fixed - will last. The lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy. Switch is firm.Function: It worked very well on the first use. I had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket. The flow was smooth. Coffee liquor starts weak, and then picks up strength. The drip stops well with the removal of the kettle - and though the manual cautiously states a 10 sec gap for drip stop, I did not find any leakage on longer removal.Overall: Very satisfied with my new coffee maker. Recommend buying.,Product doesn’t work within a month,Easy to use, and it turned out better than I expected it to be for the price.,Just Magnificent. Saves lot of time.,The plastic quality for this product is poor. It feels like a toy. I had bought a Amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this Amazon basics product,If you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its value,its cheap and breakable. And the coffee is very very light,waste of coffee and also not a good flavour.,Nice product and simple to use",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EuzetRjTL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-Drip-Coffee-Maker-Black/dp/B086GVRP63/ref=sr_1_309?qid=1672923607&s=kitchen&sr=1-309
